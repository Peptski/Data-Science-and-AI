    "In this first assignment we manipulate given data to later print it out as a scatter plot. By looking at the data you quickly realize that the life expectancy data have way more entires than the given GDP data. This has two reasons, firstly because every country has data from several years, not just 2015, in the life expectancy table. And secondly because they do not have the same set of countries to begin with. To solve this we first remove every single entry that does not have data from the year of 2015, since thats the only data we have on GDP. Then we loop through all those entries and make sure to only keep the ones where the country exists in both data sets. When we filterd out all data we do not want, we simply plot out the results. The first graph includes all data and the second one excludes the entry far right.  "

    "When looking at the result we clearly see that when the GDP per capita goes up, (X axis), the life expectancy generally also goes up. There are some countries with high life expectancy even tho the GDP is low, but not the other way around. There is in our data set only one country that has a low life expectancy while the GDP is relatively high. This one data point is the only thing contradicting the correlation between GDP and life expectancy so we would draw the conclusion that high GDP in fact does contribute to higher life expectancy. The second graph that excludes the entry far to the right simply is a zoomed in version to make the correaltion more visible.\n",

We can see on this graph that every single data point quickly gets above the average life expectancy (72 Years). There is only one exception to this which is Equatorial Guinea, that stands out a lot on the graph being extremely low life expectancy despite having quite high GDP per capita. This is however just one extreme data point and should not be the base of any conclusions, the vast majority of the data suggests that high GDP per capita actually seem to imply that the life expectancy is not low in that specific country.    \n",
